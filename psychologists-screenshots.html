          <p class="lead mb-4">Hi
            Happy birthday. Wish you abundance of success & happiness in life üåü 
            
            As I reflect on my journey in psychology, I am filled with a sense of profound gratitude for the path that led me here. It was not an easy journey, filled with obstacles and challenges, but it was through these trials that I found my true calling and the transformative moments that shaped my career.
            
            My journey began with a deep-seated curiosity about the human mind and behavior. I was always fascinated by the complexities of human nature and the ways in which our experiences shape who we are. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in psychology, where I delved deep into the theories and principles that underpin our understanding of the human mind.
            
            <p class="lead mb-4">
              As I embarked on my career, I faced numerous challenges. I encountered skepticism from some who questioned the validity of psychology as a science, and I struggled to find my place in a field that was constantly evolving. But it was through these challenges that I grew and developed as a psychologist. I learned to be resilient in the face of adversity and to constantly adapt and evolve in my practice.

There were also moments of profound transformation that shaped my career. One such moment was when I worked with a young child who had experienced trauma. Through our sessions, I witnessed the incredible resilience of the human spirit and the power of therapy to heal and transform lives. It was in that moment that I knew I had found my true calling.
<p class="lead mb-4">
  As I look back on my journey, I am reminded of the words of the great psychologist Carl Jung, who said, ‚ÄúI am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.‚Äù We are not defined by our challenges or our failures, but by the ways in which we choose to overcome them. As psychologists, we have the privilege of helping others navigate their own journeys of self-discovery and transformation.

I encourage you to embrace the challenges that come your way and to use them as opportunities for growth. Remember that your work has the power to transform lives, and that you have the ability to make a difference in the world.

Netra Bhatia

                <p class="lead mb-4">Hi Zakia. Many many happy returns of the day dear. üéâüéÜüéâüéÜMay God bless you with long, healthy and happy life.
                  It's a pleasure that I am writing this message for you. 
                  
                  <p class="lead mb-4">
                    Well, when I was in college, I happened to visit a special school and was associated with an NGO which worked with teenagers and their issues. I closely witnessed their lives and challenges faced by them. It was a wonderful feeling to be able to make changes in others lives. Also, this journey helped me to become an empowered person. Therefore, I developed interest in counseling. On the other hand, psychology came as a medium to fulfill that purpose. So, I came to this profession.
Initially, it was difficult to mark your presence. People like my parents, authorities and colleagues - none of them were aware of psychology as a profession. For them it was just talking. For years, I had to face my authorities saying, ' you are getting paid just for talking to people. You don't have assignments, notes or papers to be made.'
      <p class="lead mb-4">
        It was a very sad period . I was very disappointed. Then, I started upgrading myself. Since then I have continued my studies and courses.
This enhanced my self esteem and value in front of the authorities too. I started showing my work. 
Also, I worked on my feelings as I can't control others. I worked on my work quality, efforts, feelings and qualifications. I must say I am a great learner.üòÑ Today, I am a happy professional.
<p class="lead mb-4">
  With this I want to give you an honest opinion. I'm sure your interest in psychology is your USP. If you have interest, you need to enhance your qualifications, creative skills, the knowledge about the subject, technical knowledge and the skills to showcase your work. 
  First, work on your feelings, insecurities and concerns. Then, the above.
  I'm sure you would be a great psychologist and one day even people like me would learn from you. Waiting for that day. May God bless you. Have a great future dear.ü§óüôè

      Wish you many many happy returns of the day!
      I hear that this is the year you complete your 11th year in school which means you're left with your final year once this is through.
      I hope your high school results are a great success and that you pass out of school with flying colours!
      
      
      <p class="lead mb-4">
        Your cousin told me about how you aspire to be a psychologist some day. It makes me very glad to hear that you have taken Psychology up as a potential career choice as  not only will this broaden your horizons for professional growth, but it will also take you on a journey of deep inner knowing and awareness.

<p class="lead mb-4">
  This is the right time to get into the mental health line as it is currently booming in our country in a big way. 
<p class="lead mb-4">
  Remember the journey always seems hard in the beginning but it is those who keep going that learn the most. The beauty of our field is that learning never ends and that the  opportunities and experiences are endless.
  I wish you the best year ahead!
  Happy birthday!! üéâ
