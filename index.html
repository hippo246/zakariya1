            Sala naam aur gender decide krna hota address krne se Pehle TT
            But khaiyr, YOU TURNED 17 MASHALLAH
            Didn't think ki itna jldi waqt paar hoga lol
            It was 2020 when you messaged me out of boredom just get Khairiyat from me and then idk how you got so close and comfortable with me. You were such an innocent soul that came to me and talked about whatever problem you had. I mean rishte me to I am your mamu but with you I felt like a responsible elder brother jo kisi ke sath feel nhi kiya tha. And I have unspoken amount of love for you. I guided you through all your problems and stuff. I was really happy to see when you let go of my hand started walking on your own and dealing things yourself made me very proud. Idk what kind of weird creature you became in this world but seeing you fight in this world on your own makes me think that I AM GREAT AND COOL ASS UNCLE AND MERE SE BTTER KOI NHI HAI. But know one thing, know matter what happens you will always have my support and help. Once again Happy Birthday Chotu. Ammar~</p>
